# DIY-Vibrating-Parkinsons-Glove
There are two things new in this build: 

1.  The gloves feature a new spring-based LRA tactor design that provides more energetic and focused vibrations than comparable foam-based LRA tactors.   When foam is used to decouple LRA tactors, significant energy is lost due to internal friction in the foam.  No energy is lost when using springs for this function since springs are almost perfectly elastic.  

2.  The electronics are housed on a bluetooth neck speaker.  This keeps the wires out of the way compared to fanny pack versions.  The bluetooth speaker can also sync with your smartphone as a speakerphone and mp3 player.

Note:  There are two files here.  The 'building description" file details how to build the gloves and tactor.  The "design considerations" file discusses theoretical issues regarding LRA-type tactors.
